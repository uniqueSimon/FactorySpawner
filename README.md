**Factory Spawner** takes the hassle out of manually placing and wiring every machine.  
Simply tell it what you want to produce and how many machines you need, and it will:

- ✅ Spawn the requested machines and set their recipes
- 🔄 Automatically connect everything with belts
- ⚡ Wire up power poles and connect them to the grid
- 🛠️ Handle splitters, mergers, and constructors for smooth production chains

---

# Usage

## Quick Start

Open the chat and type your factory command, e. g.

```bash
/FactorySpawner 2 Smelter IngotIron, 3 Constructor IronPlate
```

A blueprint called "FactorySpawner" will be created. Just place it!

## Command Syntax

```bash
/FactorySpawner {number} {machine type} {recipe} {underclock}
```

(without curly braces)

- **number** → Number of machines in a row
- **machine type** → Smelter, Constructor, Assembler, Foundry, Manufacturer, Refinery, Blender, Packager, Converter, ParticleAccelerator, QuantumEncoder, CoalGenerator, FuelGenerator, NuclearReactor
- **recipe** (optional) → e.g. IngotIron, IronPlate, Motor, Computer
- **underclock** (optional) → The clock speed of each machine in the row (Value in %: 0 - 100)

You can chain multiple commands, separated by commas. Each creates a new row of machines:

```bash
/FactorySpawner {number 1} {machine type 1} {recipe 1}, {number 2} {machine type 2} {recipe 2}
```

---

# Examples

This spawns **2 Smelters** making Iron Ingots and **3 Constructors** making Iron Plates, all connected with belts and power:

```bash
/FactorySpawner 2 Smelter IngotIron, 3 Constructor IronPlate
```

Here is the config from the screenshot (without recipes).

```bash
/FactorySpawner 12 Smelter, 10 Constructor, 5 Foundry, 10 Constructor, 4 Assembler, 3 Manufacturer
```

## Automatic Tier Selection

The mod **automatically detects and uses your highest unlocked belt and pipeline tiers**!

- 🔄 **Belts**: Uses Mk1-Mk6 based on what you've unlocked
- 💧 **Pipelines**: Automatically uses Mk2 pipelines if available

You can also override the belt tier:

```bash
/FactorySpawner 2 Smelter IngotIron, 3 Constructor IronPlate, beltTier 3
```

This forces the mod to use **Mk3 belts** instead of auto-detection.
